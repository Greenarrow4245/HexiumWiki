	<h2>About HexiumSMP</h2>
	<p>
    HexiumSMP is a Survival Multiplayer (SMP) server that was officially launched on <strong>February 4, 2025</strong>. 
    Since its creation, the server has evolved with numerous improvements, making it a more engaging and enjoyable experience for players.
	</p>

	<h2>Server Growth & Improvements</h2>
	<p>
    Over time, the founder has significantly improved their skills in <strong>server management</strong> and <strong>community engagement</strong>. 
    One of the key additions is an <strong>onboarding menu</strong> for new members joining the <strong>HexiumSMP Discord server</strong>, 
    ensuring a smoother and more welcoming experience.
	</p>

	<h2>Challenges & Determination</h2>
	<p>
    Building and maintaining HexiumSMP has not been easy. The founder has faced multiple challenges, including limited server resources 
    and days when they felt like quitting. However, their dedication to the community and vision for the server kept them going, 
    ensuring that HexiumSMP continues to thrive.
	</p>

	<h2>Future Plans & Upgrades</h2>
	<p>
    Currently, HexiumSMP is hosted on <strong>Aternos</strong>, a free hosting service with restrictions. While this has been a challenge, 
    the founder is determined to upgrade to a <strong>paid server</strong> once they save enough money or receive community donations. 
    When that happens, they have promised to improve the serverâ€™s overall landscape, ensuring a smoother and more expansive experience for players.
